The work helps us begin to process the extent of the tragedy that has unfolded this past decade — and longer.</p><p>I was grateful to her for ending the story on a hopeful note. Though the knowledge of the events that followed shortly after this book’s publication add a bittersweetness that only history can.</p>",

I was primed to embrace it with open arms.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, I find that Backman’s prose rings a bit hollow to my ear, his characterizations are thin, surface-level things based on whatever popular stereotypes are near to hand, the humor too often feels forced and clichéd, and the twists and turns of his plotting are a bit too cute by half. If by some magic an exurb were to be transmuted into a book, I imagine the result would be something like this novel.</p>\n<p>I know that this book deals with heavy themes in an approachable way. I know that it has been meaningful and profound for many of its readers. Unfortunately, I am forced to admit that I walked away from the experience feeling like I had just sat through a made for TV Hallmark movie.</p>\n<p>I’m sure Fred’s a great guy! I’m glad he’s found his audience and achieved success. I don’t begrudge him that. I’m sorry that his work doesn’t resonate with me.</p>",

Picking up this book felt a bit like eating a bag of peanut m&amp;ms - full of tiny, bite-sized pieces that are sweet on the outside and a little bit hard and savory on the inside. Though to be honest, at times the “reviews” can start to feel a bit formulaic and maybe a bit too dependent on whatever quote John felt related to what he was trying to say with each subject.</p><p>It’s worth noting though, too, that far as autobiographical non-fiction goes, this one has a certain kinship with the literary pointillism of Édouard Levé (though admittedly much less morbid). A bunch of short, distinct, and loosely connect points that as a whole imply a larger, more cohesive image. I don’t particularly think that John had this in mind when he wrote it, but it’s a nice lens to read through nonetheless.</p>",

More’s novella is a 3, but the essays from Le Guin & Miéville in this edition are insightful and improve the experience enough that it’s overall a 4.</p>",

A button machine makes buttons, no matter what the power used, foot, steam, or electricity. They, no matter what the motivating force, death, love or God, made jokes.\"</p><p>On p.55: \"Man has a tropism for order. Keys in one pocket, change in another. Mandolins are tuned G D A E. The physical world had a tropism for disorder, entropy. Man against Nature...the battle of the centuries. Keys yearn to mix with change. Mandolins strive to get out of tune. Every order has within it the germ of destruction. All order is doomed, yet the battle is worth while.\"</p><p>On p.57: \"'Perhaps I can make you understand. Let's start from the beginning. A man is hired to give advice to readers of a newspaper. The job is a circulation stunt and the whole staff considers it a joke. He welcomes the job, for it might lead to a gossip column, and anyway he's tired of being a leg man. He too considers the job a joke, but after several months at it, the joke begins to escape him. He sees that the majority of the letters are profoundly humble pleas for moral and spiritual advice, that they are inarticulate expressions of genuine suffering. He also discovers that his correspondents take him seriously. For the first time in his life, he is forced to examine the values by which he lives. This examination shows him that he is the victim of the joke and not its perpetrator.'\"</p><p>And let's not fail to mention the Afterword! If you are fortunate enough to procure a copy with the succinct 20 pages punched up by Stanley Edgar Hyman, you will find they greatly enrich any further understanding you might wish to cultivate - both contextual and allegorical.</p>"

Because I find myself wondering how Steinbeck would have handled the story of Callie turned Cal -- and I think I would have found Steinbeck's telling more immersive.</p><p>This is likely my own fault more so than Eugenides'.</p>"

Perhaps I feel compelled by the praise that critics shower down on his work.  But more truthfully, I think it's because of works like this and <em>Play</em>. Works were it's not all evident at first, but where, as you think about it for days after - which you inevitably will - you realize that there was some deep seated truth within yourself that's been elucidated because of Beckett.</p><p>So here, in this scene of endless revisiting and death and endings, I found myself rereading over and over again. Then just sitting back and letting the realization of his meaning (for meaning is more important than words for Beckett) wash over me.</p><p> \"Absence supreme good and yet. Illumination then go again and on return no more trace. On earth's face. Of what was never. And if by mishap some left then go again. For good again. So on.

        "review": "<p>Eggers's most recent novel is full of potential. Unfortunately his purposeful use of sparse prose gives the reader the feeling that this novel lacked effort on the part of the author, which, I am sure, was by no means the case.</p><p>After finishing the book I found myself slightly frustrated. All the elements were there. A myriad of magnificent and relevant themes were touched on. There were moments of keen insight that I haven't experienced elsewhere. But lurking at the bottom of it all was the feeling that this was something just thrown together: easily read, easily dismissed.</p><p>Truthfully, though, after some reflection I find myself wondering if Eggers hasn't done this to prove his point. A novel with Alan Clay as the protagonist surely would not be filled with beautiful language and supreme revelation. In fact, a novel written around Alan Clay would seem sparse and altogether unfulfilling.</p><p>This possibility did not dawn on me until the last few pages (I won't mention when or why). And now, as I think back to the rest of the novel, I can say that there is probably something to this idea. And I commend Eggers for the simplicity and unassuming way in which he has made me tremble. First, at our present digital and globalized age and all its complication and consequence. Second, at the terrors of the modern man's adulthood.</p>",

We as readers are able only to imagine - albeit, with inherent inaccuracy - how beautiful the urn might have been when it was still intact.</p><p>I disagree that review.</p><p>This book is beautiful, but not because it is broken or fragmented. It is beautiful in the same way that Michelangelo's \"prisoners\" are beautiful. This book is an unfinished masterpiece, but it is still the work of a master. David Foster Wallace had chosen his stone, begun carving out the images and details, and was shaping his vision. We are left with something that is truly great, not because it is finished, but because its unfinished beauty gives a glimpse of how the artist worked and where his genius might have led had he continued.</p><p>All this being said, like Michelangelo's prisoners, The Pale King does seem oddly complete in its own right. And I cannot speak highly enough about this man's writing and the brilliance with which he attempted to express his ideas.</p>",
