The little bit I remember is that it was quite dry and I spent most of my time parsing academic footnotes.</p><p>The full title of this edition is “Gilgamesh: A New Rendering in English Verse.” David Ferry, who doesn’t read cuneiform or speak Sumerian or Babylonian, has a pretty straightforward goal with his rendering: based one what we know about the epic and its history, make the most accessible version of this poem for contemporary English readers. As a result, it’s not a translation so much as it is an adaptation. This book is to the original epic what “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_the_Man?wprov=sfti1\">She’s the Man</a>” is to Shakespeare’s “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night?wprov=sfti1#\">Twelfth Night</a>.”</p><p>Does Ferry succeed? I think he does, for the most part. I certainly felt more affected by this story. The characters felt more alive. The images felt more vivid. In particular, the section where Gilgamesh follows the path of the sun in the dark tunnels under the mountain was very well done.</p>",

        "review": "<p>I was very interested in this history for a few reasons.</p><p>First, de Tocqueville is writing about the French Revolution in the aftermath of the 1848 Revolution and was serving in the 2<sup>ème</sup> République as it lapsed into empire — actions for which he was subsequently jailed. No matter how objective you try to be, experiences like this are bound to color your view of history. He’s also writing about the Revolution with no knowledge of the subsequent restoration of democracy in France. This book came out 14 years before the 3<sup>ème</sup> République would appear. (France is currently on its 5th Republic for those keeping score.)</p><p>Second, I wanted a better understanding of how this change was understood in the more immediate aftermath of the Revolution. De Tocqueville wasn’t alive during 1789, but he and his contemporaries lived in the long shadow of its consequences.</p><p>This context in mind, it turned out to be an instructive and rewarding read! He goes to great pains to demonstrate that characteristics of French government and administrative structure that are often credited to the Revolution were in fact established under the Ancien Régime; administrative centralization being a key example. Perhaps most eye opening was his (fairly convincing) argument that the Revolution was triggered not because the regime of Louis XVI was the most oppressive, but rather because its poorly executed reforms served to throw the injustice of the existing system into sharper relief.</p><p>De Tocqueville was a liberal, in the 19th c. sense, and the bias inherent in that framing shows up quite often in his characterizations and conclusions. However, it’s hard to hold that against him when he hits you with great aphoristic lines like:</p><blockquote><p>Men who value only those material advantages from freedom have never kept it long.</p></blockquote><p>As with much history from before the 20th c., sources and citations are not rigorous. At times he writes phrases like “I have held a secret document in my hand that stated…” and it’s hard not to arch an eyebrow. There are also some curious artifacts of the context in which it was written. For example, he refers to Napoleon Bonaparte several times, but never by name. Only using monikers like  “the despot.” A rhetorical tic evokes parallels to some contemporary posting habits in the U.S.</p><p>As he nears the end of his argument you start to get a real sense of his bitterness at the failures of 1848 and his cynicism about France’s ability to govern itself democratically. I hadn’t planned to, but this final turn does make me interested in picking up a copy of his <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37892/37892-h/37892-h.htm\">Souvenirs</a> of 1848.</p>",

There’s a fantastic stanza early on that captures this well:</p><blockquote><p>But on certain afternoons<br>the Republic of Psalms opens up<br>and I grow frightened that I haven’t lived, died, not enough<br>to scratch this ecstasy into vowels, hear<br>splashes of clear, biblical speech.</p></blockquote></p><p>Lines like these are why Kaminsky is one of the most interesting modern poets, as far as I’m concerned.</p><p>This edition also includes several fun Easter eggs in the acknowledgements.

Felt oddly appropriate to finish on the Ballad of Billy Budd with the sound of waves from a short distance, gulls squawking overhead.</p><p>Melville’s turn to poetry at the end of his career is endlessly fascinating to me. His commitment to traditional, iambic forms at a time when his contemporaries (namely, Walt Whitman) were doing incredibly interesting things with blank verse almost feels like a practical joke or a cantankerous reaction to “the times.” But, and especially with his epic poem “Clarel,” he is doing some things that are worth paying attention to. </p><p>What’s more, in his Civil War poems, despite making his allegiances clear from the first page, he is constantly undercutting the more cliched expectations for war poems. Every line about heroism or bravery is quickly undercut by the cold realities of the brutal conflict.</p><p>Not for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed most of it. Will probably be picking up the full text of “Clarel” soon.</p>",

Now I can more confidently say that you should be required to read this before you’re allowed to pitch your start up idea.</p><p>Jokes aside, it’s hard to read this novel without any prior conceptions. This story in all its mutations and evolutions takes up so much space in the modern cultural imagination that you’d be forgiven for thinking you know it backward and forward already. But Shelley’s original is really a masterclass in so many things: the gothic style, the epistolary, layered and conflicting narrative perspectives, and of course the parable of how misguided our obsession with scientific progress can be if divorced from a moral foundation.</p><p>Aside from seething with jealousy that Shelley managed to write something so good when she was only 18, I enjoyed reading it through two lenses I had come across recently.  First, of course, the contemporary frenzy about generative “A.I.”. Second, as the Danish author Olga Ravn has pointed out, it can understood as a rich metaphor for motherhood. Both of these lenses were rewarding and fruitful.</p>",

Tom Crewe’s <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n11/tom-crewe/my-hands-in-my-face\">piece in LRB</a> made me want to know if it was really so bad. I also listened to interviews with Ocean Vuong and read some of the criticism of the criticism.</p><p>Four hundred pages later, here’s where I am: I did not enjoy reading this book. I think I may have enjoyed reading the book that Ocean Vuong talks about in his interviews. But the aspirations of the artist do not appear to have made it to the page.</p><p>Of course, there’s a chance that Vuong is writing outside of the tradition I am most familiar with. This is often brought up by defenders of the novel, but these counter arguments rest on theories of fiction and narrative frameworks. And none of them point to anything in the prose that adequately supports them — at least, none of the ones I have found.</p><p>There’s this trend in publishing where people emphasize a book being “written by a poet.” Often it serves as an important part of the marketing plan when a novel is published. I think the reason publishers lead with it is because it carries with it the assumption that poets, more so than your typical prose writer, will agonize over ever syllable, simile, and metaphor in the book. That they’ll invent new forms to hold their unique vision of the world, rather than stick to rote or prescribed rules of narrative. And this is maybe what’s most frustrating about this book. It is so generic and unconsidered in almost every way. The relationships that are supposed to anchor the lack of action feel one-dimensional and inauthentic. The “comedic set pieces” feel dropped in and unearned. Even when he’s reaching for lyrical images, they come across as forced and heavy-handed.</p><p>For what it’s worth, though, I don’t think I’d forgive even a non-poet novelist for writing the simile: “two fast-food workers in a shrink’s office, like a <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon caption contest.”</p><p>At the end of the day, there was almost something here. There were several places in this book where you could see Vuong reaching for something more insightful, more profound, only to watch him trip over his own unchecked sentimentalism. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe history will look back at this book and judge it more kindly. Right now, though, it feels like Vuong’s editors assumed they had a hit and didn’t read the manuscript too closely.</p>",

Maybe it’s because of my upbringing, but his rigorously logical structure serves him better here than in his sociological texts.

        "review": "<p>In the interest of full transparency, I’ve tried and failed to read the full text of Diderot’s 18th century exploration of fate, free will, and the conventions of narrative form on and off since roughly 2010. Part of the problem was that I was trying to read in the original French. This in and of itself isn’t necessarily an insurmountable hurdle for me. However, the copy I owned was just a brief introduction and then the text. More often than not I was tripped up when I came across some old scrap of idiom that I wasn’t familiar with or a dated cultural reference that was completely unknown to me. As a result, I would often lose momentum and question why I was putting myself through this experience.</p></p>Fortunately, all of this changed once I picked up a copy of David Coward’s English translation. Not only did the extensive end notes and explanations come to my aid whenever I was at risk of drowning under mountains of misunderstood references, but his version finally helped me understand — more emotionally than intellectually, because this was something I knew but couldn’t quite grasp as I read the French — just how playful and funny Diderot’s prose is. Of course, though, this also left me with doubts about my own ability to read and appreciate the nuances of written French. I consoled myself by reading the English side by side with my original copy. Occasionally, I would read an especially flowery bit of archaic British idiom and turn to my French copy only to discover that Coward allowed himself to reach for the something more playful or unexpected.</p></p>I don’t advertise it much, but as an undergraduate I earned a certification in Translation Studies (specifically literary translation), and there was a not inconsequential amount of time in my early adulthood where I thought I might become a literary translator of experimental fiction. Of course, these thoughts quickly evaporated the first time I sat down and calculated the total debt I had shouldered as a consequence of my degree(s). (An event which led, ultimately, to a winding career in IT consulting and software engineering instead.) Nevertheless, being able to read an original and a translation side by side like this, to see the decisions a translator made either to embellish, standardize, or make the original more legible to a foreign audience still fascinates me.</p><p>But, Reader, you are probably asking what my impressions of Diderot’s text were. Fear not, now that I have dispensed with personal anecdotes I shall meet your expectations head on.</p><p>The story and its telling still feel unconventional +250 years after the book was written. Diderot is very much an artist at play here. Experimenting with form, tone, and gleefully subverting the expectations of his readers — even going so far as to put words into your mouth and then tell you that you are a fool for asking such questions.</p><p>The meandering protagonist and his master discuss weighty subjects, they discuss frivolous subjects, they get sidetracked by digressions, they forget where they left off. It’s somehow both a masterclass in the minute detail necessary for realism and a rebuke of it.</p><p>What can I say? Read the classics. You won’t regret it. Or maybe you will, but, as I’m sure Diderot would tell you, that’s your problem, not his.</p>",

        "review": "<p>It is tempting, very tempting, with a book such as this to praise it effusively the moment you have finished reading. This impulse is driven by the book’s well established reputation among the reading public as one of “the greatest books ever written” as well as the exceptional length of the text. I want to resist that impulse, as best I can, and give my honest assessment of the book’s prose, themes, and the overall impression it has made on me.</p>\n<p>As far as writing style, I am incredibly conflicted. The prose is shaggy and erratic. Characters, more often than not, “seem” to feel things rather than just feeling them. Action happens “suddenly” so often it begins to lose any sort of urgency or meaning. And descriptions lean far too heavily on the terms “sort of” or “something like.” These, to my mind, are all the hallmarks of a writer who has not taken the time to refine their work or trim the fat from their initial drafts. That being said, this criticism is complicated by the fact of this being a work in translation (though the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation gives every indication that it is meticulously researched and faithful to the original) and the fact, mentioned in this edition’s Introduction, that Dostoevsky has purposefully crafted this narrative voice. So I’m led to believe the effect is intentional. And yet. And yet, I can’t bring myself to fully embrace the argument.</p>\n<p>Fortunately the themes do not fall victim to the same criticism. This is where Dostoevsky’s talent is most on display. Characters are very fully developed. The world feels real and lived in. The choreography of the plot is meticulous and well executed. My main gripe here is the identities of the characters and how they align with the ideas Dostoevsky explores. There is a thread of classicism — why else would the true criminal be the lowest born of the brothers? — and he doesn’t seem to have any interest in criticizing the social hierarchies that forced them all into their fates. I’ll also say, the core premise and the didactic nature of the denouement feels preachy and heavy handed at different points. The brother who puts his faith in his own reason is driven mad by his failure to understand its implications and his possible role in the consequences. The brother who dedicated himself to the church is a hero who gets the last word. Perhaps not something that 19th century Russia was ready for, but I would have preferred that Dostoevsky leaned into the ambiguity of the crime and the trial that followed. Give us less certainty about the truth and our understanding of what happened. He flirts with this toward the end, but then goes out of his way to explicitly make his point about the truth and the implications of it. Of course, I can’t hold this against the work, it’s simply that I am partial to stories different than the one Dostoevsky decided to tell.</p>\n<p>After a few months lugging this book around, I’ll say that the overall impression was good. Maybe not profound. Maybe not life altering. But I can’t say that the time was wasted. There are some moments in the book that are truly beautiful. The Grand Inquisitor chapter was excellent, it really holds up! Perhaps my intense scrutiny is actually just the self-preserving tick of a jealous writer, secretly anxious he’ll never accomplish anything as enduring as the book he’s just read. I’m too close to the situation to say for sure. In any case, this is the second Dostoevsky novel I’ve read, the first being The Double, and the opinion that’s crystallizing about his body of work is this: he has an incredible talent for outlining and probing the ideas and anxieties that underpin modern life, but his prose does a disservice to these insights.</p>\n<p>And so for that — and I say this with affection — I think he might be the greatest bad writer I have ever had the pleasure of reading.</p>",

If by some magic an exurb were to be transmuted into a book, I imagine the result would be something like this novel.</p>\n<p>I know that this book deals with heavy themes in an approachable way.

Picking up this book felt a bit like eating a bag of peanut m&amp;ms - full of tiny, bite-sized pieces that are sweet on the outside and a little bit hard and savory on the inside. Though to be honest, at times the “reviews” can start to feel a bit formulaic and maybe a bit too dependent on whatever quote John felt related to what he was trying to say with each subject.</p><p>It’s worth noting though, too, that far as autobiographical non-fiction goes, this one has a certain kinship with the literary pointillism of Édouard Levé (though admittedly much less morbid). A bunch of short, distinct, and loosely connect points that as a whole imply a larger, more cohesive image. I don’t particularly think that John had this in mind when he wrote it, but it’s a nice lens to read through nonetheless.</p>",

A button machine makes buttons, no matter what the power used, foot, steam, or electricity. They, no matter what the motivating force, death, love or God, made jokes.\"</p><p>On p.55: \"Man has a tropism for order. Keys in one pocket, change in another. Mandolins are tuned G D A E. The physical world had a tropism for disorder, entropy. Man against Nature...the battle of the centuries. Keys yearn to mix with change. Mandolins strive to get out of tune. Every order has within it the germ of destruction. All order is doomed, yet the battle is worth while.\"</p><p>On p.57: \"'Perhaps I can make you understand. Let's start from the beginning. A man is hired to give advice to readers of a newspaper. The job is a circulation stunt and the whole staff considers it a joke. He welcomes the job, for it might lead to a gossip column, and anyway he's tired of being a leg man. He too considers the job a joke, but after several months at it, the joke begins to escape him. He sees that the majority of the letters are profoundly humble pleas for moral and spiritual advice, that they are inarticulate expressions of genuine suffering. He also discovers that his correspondents take him seriously. For the first time in his life, he is forced to examine the values by which he lives. This examination shows him that he is the victim of the joke and not its perpetrator.'\"</p><p>And let's not fail to mention the Afterword! If you are fortunate enough to procure a copy with the succinct 20 pages punched up by Stanley Edgar Hyman, you will find they greatly enrich any further understanding you might wish to cultivate - both contextual and allegorical.</p>"

Perhaps I feel compelled by the praise that critics shower down on his work.  But more truthfully, I think it's because of works like this and <em>Play</em>. Works were it's not all evident at first, but where, as you think about it for days after - which you inevitably will - you realize that there was some deep seated truth within yourself that's been elucidated because of Beckett.</p><p>So here, in this scene of endless revisiting and death and endings, I found myself rereading over and over again. Then just sitting back and letting the realization of his meaning (for meaning is more important than words for Beckett) wash over me.</p><p> \"Absence supreme good and yet.

Unfortunately his purposeful use of sparse prose gives the reader the feeling that this novel lacked effort on the part of the author, which, I am sure, was by no means the case.</p><p>After finishing the book I found myself slightly frustrated. All the elements were there. A myriad of magnificent and relevant themes were touched on. There were moments of keen insight that I haven't experienced elsewhere. But lurking at the bottom of it all was the feeling that this was something just thrown together: easily read, easily dismissed.</p><p>Truthfully, though, after some reflection I find myself wondering if Eggers hasn't done this to prove his point. A novel with Alan Clay as the protagonist surely would not be filled with beautiful language and supreme revelation. In fact, a novel written around Alan Clay would seem sparse and altogether unfulfilling.</p><p>This possibility did not dawn on me until the last few pages (I won't mention when or why). And now, as I think back to the rest of the novel, I can say that there is probably something to this idea. And I commend Eggers for the simplicity and unassuming way in which he has made me tremble. First, at our present digital and globalized age and all its complication and consequence. Second, at the terrors of the modern man's adulthood.</p>",

We as readers are able only to imagine - albeit, with inherent inaccuracy - how beautiful the urn might have been when it was still intact.</p><p>I disagree that review.</p><p>This book is beautiful, but not because it is broken or fragmented. It is beautiful in the same way that Michelangelo's \"prisoners\" are beautiful. This book is an unfinished masterpiece, but it is still the work of a master. David Foster Wallace had chosen his stone, begun carving out the images and details, and was shaping his vision. We are left with something that is truly great, not because it is finished, but because its unfinished beauty gives a glimpse of how the artist worked and where his genius might have led had he continued.</p><p>All this being said, like Michelangelo's prisoners, The Pale King does seem oddly complete in its own right. And I cannot speak highly enough about this man's writing and the brilliance with which he attempted to express his ideas.</p>",
