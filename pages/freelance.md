In 2024, my wife was hired for her dream job and became a U.S. Foreign Service Officer. This job requires our family to move to a different part of the world every 2-3 years. Consequently, I am prioritizing freelance work, which provides me with some needed flexibility around my working hours & commitments.

## Software Engineering

I have +10 years experience working in software in various roles: data analyst, data scientist, support engineer, and software engineer. A more detailed history of my experience can be found in the [work section](/work) of this site.

I do my fastest work in Node.js. But I have also enjoyed working in Python & Go. I have a strong background in scaling backend apps & improving systems built on AWS.

My frontend experience is less prominent but still worth mentioning. I have [strong opinions](/notes/2024/rules-for-this-website/) on keeping static websites performant. I have been proud of contributions made to various web apps and libraries over the years (e.g. [Static Images API Playground](https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/static/) & [@mapbox/quilt](https://github.com/mapbox/quilt)).

Finally, I miss working with maps. I will jump at any opportunities to take on map work.

## Writing

Regardless of my availability, I am always interested in writing projects. More specifically, I strongly encourage you to reach out if you'd like to commission any of the following:
- Essays ([examples](/writing))
- Book Reviews ([examples](/shelf))
- Travel Writing ([examples](/tags/travel))

I also enjoy writing technical documentation. However, I consider it more of a piece with Software Engineering and will approach any projects from that perspective.

## Inquiries

If you are interested in working with me in any of the above capacities, please feel free to reach out directly via **[josh@cyberb.space](mailto:josh@cyberb.space)**.

For non-writing projects, I like to keep the process for new work as straightforward as possible:
1. After an initial e-mail, I will reach out to schedule a meeting to discuss your project in greater detail.
1. Based on our conversation, I will share my preferred rate and ideal timeline.
1. If we agree on terms, we sign a written agreement.
1. Work can start as soon as a contract is finalized.

For writing projects, I understand that every publication has its own set of expectations and editorial workflows. I will do my best to accommodate yours if we agree to work together.
