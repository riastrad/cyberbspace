# cyber(b)space.

Hi. I'm Josh. I'm a Software Engineer currently working on the [Static APIs](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/static-images/) at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com). Previously, I have been [a few other things](/work/).

Like most personal sites, I use this space to house two different aspects of my digital life. The most frequently updated section is my personal blog. It includes some decades old travel writing and a handful of one-offs from more recent days. I frequently write technical posts for my employer, and as a result I often opt to spend my free time writing about other subjects that interest me here. There's also a resume, but it's out-of-date more often than it's up-to-date.

If you prefer the social web rather than just being talked at, I do have a seat saved [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/erbitron), but I am - thankfully - [not very active these days](/notes/2020/kill-the-feed/).
