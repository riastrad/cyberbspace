# Welcome to cyber(b)space.

You've stumbled upon the personal website of [Josh Erb](mailto:josherb4@gmail.com). I am currently a Backend Engineer for the Maps team at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com).

This site is home to two things. Primarily, it contains my blog, which includes some decades old travel writing and a few one-offs from more recent days. I tell myself I will update it frequently, but the rate of my posts has proven to be rather stochastic.

This site also houses a résumé page that is poorly formatted and frequently out of date. Don't worry, I'm [working on it](https://github.com/riastrad/cyberbspace/issues/6).

If you prefer the social web rather than just being talked at, I am - regrettably - also active [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/erbitron).
