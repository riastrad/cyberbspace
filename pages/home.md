This is the personal website of [Josh Erb](mailto:josherb4@gmail.com), a technology professional currently living in the Washington, DC area.

If you are here by mistake, that's too bad. **BUT**, that doesn't mean you can't poke around and see what I've set up! Aside from this home page, there's a frequently out-of-date résumé page and a "showcase" page. The showcase contains (or will _eventually_ contain) brief overviews of my completed pet projects, as well as links to the associated code.
