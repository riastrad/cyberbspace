# cyber(b)space.

Hi. I'm Josh. I'm a Software Engineer located in the Washington, DC area. I am an on-and-off trail runner, an autodidact who likes to tinker with things I don't understand, and - most of all - an avid reader. I'm currently reading <span id="currently-reading"><a href="https://oku.club/user/riastrad/collection/reading">these books</a></span>.

Like most personal sites, I use this space to house two different aspects of my digital life: a personal blog and an often out-of-date resume. I update the blog whenever something strikes me as worth writing a bit about, it also has some decades-old travel writing.

If you prefer the social web rather than just being talked at, you can find me squatting <a rel="me" href="https://zirk.us/@riastrad">over on Mastodon</a>. If you're wondering why Mastodon instead of Twitter, I wrote [a little post](/notes/2022/bye-bye-birdie/) to try to articulate why I decided to leave.
