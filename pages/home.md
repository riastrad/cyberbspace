You've stumbled upon the personal website of [Josh Erb](mailto:josherb4@gmail.com). I am currently a Mobile Support Engineer at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com).

If you are here by mistake, that's too bad. **BUT**, please feel free to poke around before leaving. Aside from just a boring old resume I've also got a blog filled with some random opinions that no one really asked for.

Any comments or feedback about the site? Feel free to reach out me. I have the great -misfortune of being available [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/erbitron).
