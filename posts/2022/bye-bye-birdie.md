Every time I start a new work journal[^1], I like to write a quote on the inside cover that feels like it has some insight into the state of the world as I currently experience it. In my journal for the past couple years, I wrote the following:

> "To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self."

— Caroline Busta, "[The internet didn’t kill counterculture — you just won’t find it on Instagram](https://documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/)" (_retrieved on 18-Jan-2021_)

This feels particularly prescient as we all watch a decade-old[^2] micro-blogging site be dismembered by a man with the emotional control of a toddler. Oddly enough, I don't think the hostile takeover of Twitter by an ultra rich megalomaniac changed my relationship to the site that much. Twitter has always been owned by ultra rich megalomaniacs, the previous ones were just a little less visible and were constantly mugging the camera looking for approval.

Spending less time there is something I've been thinking about for quite some time, as evidenced by previous posts on this blog (ref. exhibits [A](/notes/2020/kill-the-feed/) & [B](/notes/2021/requiem-for-a-feed/)). However, with recent changes it has become unavoidably clear that staying in a place where my ad impressions directly help prop up the boots of a deranged, fascist-curious oligarch who would remake the world in his own, shitty image. If this is going to happen, I'm going to exercise the only form of direct action I can: I'm going to purposefully remove my contribution to the bottom line.

Is writing a blog about this performative? Yes. Am I still grappling with the things I'll lose by disconnecting entirely? Also yes. I use Twitter to stay up to date on labor fights and local initiatives and all these important things that I care deeply about. But I'm making the conscious choice because every additional day I spent on that website after the takeover has made it increasingly clear that the decision to stay or go has moral implications.

I've pulled my archive and I'll probably spend a weekend figuring out how I want to host it here on my personal site, for posterity. So many formative experience as captured in the last couple years of my Twitter activity[^2] that feel worth archiving to some extent.

I find these things are best if you just rip the band-aid instead of scheduling them. Apologies for the short notice. If you're one of the few who followed me on Twitter and you want to stay in touch, I'm still not sure where I'll end up. For the moment, I'm on a mastodon instance as [riastrad@zirk.us](https://zirk.us/@riastrad) it's fully of academics and writers and is generally quite a pleasant place to spend time.

Ultimately, though, I'll be dedicating my energy to improving my non-digital social network. For the moment, and as best I can, I'll continue cherish and nurture spaces that the billionaire class hasn't schemed their way to[^3].

[^1]: Yes, this is something I do. No, I don't think it's weird.
[^2]: Twitter was founded in 2006, so it's not quite yet "decade*s*-old", which is kind of wild to think about.
[^3]: Notably, when the Mapbox Workers Union went public and the network the visibility into contemporary labor organizing this has helped me cultivate.
[^4]: These spaces also have the benefit of containing considerably fewer neo-confederates and Nazis (i.e. none)
