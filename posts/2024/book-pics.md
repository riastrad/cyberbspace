The web app I've been using to track my reading — [Oku](https://oku.club) — hasn't solved the problem of book covers for a given edition. Especially if it's an older edition or a less popular book (read: from an Indie Press). I don't hold this against Oku. They are a small team doing this on the side. And they probably don't have the funds or desire to pay a 3<sup>rd</sup> party for access to a database of cover images.[^1]

But as a result, when I pull up the list of books I've read recently on the app, I see a bunch of bland, grey squares where the covers should be. I didn't think this bothered me, but this year, I have found myself taking pictures of the books I'm reading as I'm reading them. Here's one I finished recently:

{% dither "/img/blog/2024/book-pics-1.png" %}
<div class="center-text"><small>Chuck has a weakness for the melodramatic, but then again so do I.</small></div>

There's something oddly comforting about this practice of personal record keeping. Rather than rely on someone else to provide an "official" cover image for a book, I have a record of the exact cover in the exact state it was when I read it. Even better, these photos include visual reminders about where I was doing the reading. Here's one I read earlier this year before moving abroad. It immediately reminds me of sitting in my old apartment's living room in the Spring:

{% dither "/img/blog/2024/book-pics-2.png" %}
<div class="center-text"><small>Meghan O'Gieblyn's latest memoir / essay collection is worth checking out, if you haven't already.</small></div>

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with these pictures. Maybe I'll compile them and build my own personal database of books _in situ_. Maybe I'll just keep them on my phone, and stumble across them from time to time. Each one tied to the memory of a place & a feeling.
