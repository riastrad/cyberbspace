You may be asking yourself the question, "What is the point of this navel-gazing post? Why not just post a screenshot of your streaming app's "wrapped" stats and move on with your life?" Well, first of all, now that I have a son, my streaming stats are dominated by children's songs. I love those songs & I enjoy dancing around the apartment with him while they play, but I also don't think they give an accurate picture of my aesthetic tendencies.

Second, streaming services have narrow scopes of interest. I get different "wrapped" notifications for music, books, & films. I want to share an overview of the things I enjoyed this past year, but there's no way I'm going to post screenshots from a bunch of different apps. That's tacky.

Finally, and most importantly, I read [this blog](https://www.hearingthings.co/spotify-wrapped-2024/) from **Hearing Things** and then I saw Tom MacWright's [post](https://macwright.com/2024/12/06/bandcamp-wrapped) about making his own wrapped for Bandcamp purchases, and these two well-timed posts kicked off a train of thought. I've emerged at the end of this train pretty adamant that passively letting data harvesters tell me what is or isn't my taste does not feel like an act of self-discovery. Instead, it feels like relinquishing control of my own sensibilities to a corporation.

In light of this, here are my the curated highlights of the art and entertainment that I've engaged with this past year. I tried to approach this is an opportunity to provide succinct recommendations for things I genuinely enjoyed and less of a coldly analytical look back at the year.

## BOOKS

Here are the high-level stats:

| genre       | count |
| ----------- | ----- |
| non-fiction | 8     |
| fiction     | 18    |
| total       | 26    |

I typically aim for about 20 books a year. [Previously](/notes/2022/last-year-s-reads/) I've written about the blend of translation, author backgrounds, &c. I'm not going to dive too deeply into that here, this section is based entirely on books that I would recommend to you if the opportunity came up in casual conversation.

#### [His Master's Voice](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27714066W/His_Master%27s_Voice?edition=key%3A/books/OL37809066M) by Stanisław Lem

I'm long overdue for a write up of why I think everyone remotely interested in technology and science should be required to read every novel that of Lem wrote. I read this book toward the beginning of the year and it immediately went into my Top 5 all time books.

Lem's ability to take a common science fiction trope (e.g. we've received a message from outer space) and unwind it in the most philosophically and logically rigorous way possible (e.g. we can never hope to fully understand it, maybe it's a test we've failed) is unparalleled.

#### [The Hole](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20171665W/The_Hole?edition=key%3A/books/OL27354788M) by Hye-young Pyun
Well-executed body horror whose staying power isn't just because of shock value is rare. In this book, you both fear for the protagonist and despise him for how he lived his life prior to the car accident that left him wholly dependent on his mother-in-law's care.

#### [God Human Animal Machine](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24894855W/God_Human_Animal_Machine?edition=key%3A/books/OL37579693M) by Meghan O'Gieblyn
A very personal and incisive collection of essays from a writer who was not on my radar prior to this year. O'Gieblyn moves seamlessly between the deeply personal accounts over her wrestling with religion and the analytical discussions of technology's manifestly religious status in contemporary society.

#### [A Very Easy Death](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL35713307W/Very_Easy_Death?edition=key%3A/books/OL48177396M) by Simone de Beauvoir
I debated whether or not to include this one on the list. It was so incredibly hard to read. Touched so many raw nerves. But also, it was such a deeply profound look at the relationship between a mother and daughter, life and death, and how incredibly hard it can be when all of these things intersect.

#### [Propaganda](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1985884W/Propaganda_the_formation_of_men%27s_attitudes) by Jacques Ellul
This one is a last minute entry, as I just finished reading it this past week. It is also the exception to my criteria for inclusion in this post. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone in casual conversation.

Ellul trained as a lawyer and this really shines through in the ways that he structures his arguments (i.e. so thorough & meticulous as to make you set the book down). There's also Ellul's Christianity, which at times seems to cloud his analysis (i.e. causes him to go out of his way to assert that propaganda is possible because societal values have eroded and morals are no longer fixed).

Setting caveats aside, though, this book was most interesting in how it approached the phenomenon of propaganda in modern, technological societies. One of Ellul's main insights is that propaganda is not necessarily — or only? — an action taken by nefarious actors seeking to brainwash the masses. Rather, he views it as a sociological phenomenon that is inevitable wherever large, technological societies emerge. Fascinating analysis that had me re-evaluating my understanding of the use, purposes, and threats of propaganda in modern society.

## MUSIC

#### Pedro the Lion
Let's get the overly sentimental one out of the way first. David Bazan was a pastor's son who moved around a bunch as a kid. I was a pastor's son who moved around as kid. He's currently releasing an autobiographical album for each town he lived in during childhood. The latest, **Santa Cruz**, is my favorite of the series so far:

<br />

#### Timber Timbre
Stumbled across Taylor Kirk's music completely by accident and I can't stop listening to it. He manages write these songs that can be both haunting and inviting in all the right ways.

<br />

#### Ana Lua Caiano
There's something special in Caiano's album **Vou Ficar Neste Quadrado** that I have trouble putting my finger on. It feels like a head-on collision between old and new, and the wreckage turns out to be something wholly its own.

<div align=center><iframe style="border: 0; height: 500px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=967425578/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=medium/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://analuacaiano.bandcamp.com/album/vou-ficar-neste-quadrado">Vou Ficar Neste Quadrado by Ana Lua Caiano</a></iframe></div>
<br />

#### Descartes a Kant
An art rock band from Mexico City, their album **After Destruction** really transcends the form. It's not a collection of songs so much as it is a sonically conveyed dramatic play. At the same time it doesn't feel right to call it a concept album? I have trouble putting it into words. Regardless of category, this is an album that demands your attention. Monopolizes it. Every time I have put it on this year, I have been absorbed by the story that unfolds. Unusable as background music.

<br />

#### Late Entries that Merit a Mention
I won't dive into the details for these bands. But I've been in a real post-punk, avant-garde, jazz wormhole the last few months of this year and I've discovered a few great bands that'll probably end up in next year's write up.

In no particular order:
* [Maruja](https://marujaofficial.bandcamp.com/)
* [Melt Yourself Down](https://meltyourselfdown.bandcamp.com/)
* [The Comet is Coming](https://thecometiscoming.bandcamp.com/)

## FILMS
I did not realize this until I sat down to write them up, but all of the films I enjoyed most this past year came out in the previous decade. Listen, it's hard to stay on top of my to-be-watched list.

#### [Mandy](https://letterboxd.com/film/mandy-2018/), directed by Panos Cosmatos
I finally got around to watching this psychedelic horror, revenge film this past year even though it came out over half a decade ago. Nic Cage was amazing, as always[^1]. Even more, though, I found the film to be original both aesthetically and thematically.

#### [The Lighthouse](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/), directed by Robert Eggers
Thrilled that someone is still out there making weird and unexpected films. The cinematography, dialogue, and symbolism on display is some of the best in recent memory.

#### [Columbus](https://letterboxd.com/film/columbus-2017/), directed by Kogonada
My favorite film that I watched this past year, and to my eternal surprise it's an understated little story that takes place in Columbus, Indiana. The cinematography is exceptional, the characters feel real and complicated, and the story unfolds on its own terms and tugs at your heart. Turn off your phone, dim the lights, and let this film absorb you.

[^1]: I won't litigate this argument here. But I should state explicitly and in no uncertain terms that I think Nicolas Cage is one of the most innovative and interesting performers of our time. The movies he is in are not always good, but any movie I see him is inevitably a delight as you get to experience what he does with the material.
