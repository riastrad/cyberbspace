I'm starting to feel nostalgic about the routines in my life, which is weird. Maybe because I know that the shape of my daily life is [about to change](/notes/2024/new-spaces). There's one routine in particular I'm going to miss. I'm fortunate to live within walking distance to my son's daycare. Every morning I grab his stroller and walk him through the Capitol Hill neighborhood of DC for about 15 minutes before dropping him off.

I wanted to capture the impression of this quiet morning walk. It's not really possible unless you're there and sensitive to the moment. Everything else is just a crude reproduction. Nonetheless, I recorded a 5(_ish_) minute chunk of it this week, and I'm sharing it here. It's a meditative track. The constant rumble of the stroller's wheels on the brick sidewalk. The ructions of vehicle engines as they speed by or slow down for speed bumps. A random snatch of words as I walk by neighbors having idle conversations. But mostly the birds. More birds that you might think if you weren't paying attention.

As I get older, I realize more and more what a gift it is to be alive to the world around me. Why would I put in headphones when there is so much to be hear every morning?
