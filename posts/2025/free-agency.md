In 2019, I had the opportunity to see Ted Chiang speak at the vaunted Politics & Prose during the book tour for [_Exhalation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories). I waited patiently in line for him to sign my copy and then asked him with a shaky voice if he would continue to freelance as a technical writer given the increased recognition of his work. He gave me a wry smile and said, "For now." Then he signed my book and asked me if I knew anything about [Gene Wolfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wolfe) & his contributions to the Pringles™ slicing machine.

If you've followed this blog at all in the last year and a half, you'll likely know that in 2024, my wife was hired for her dream job and became a U.S. Foreign Service Officer. This job requires our family to move to a different part of the world every 2-3 years. This a classic Faustian bargain, simultaneously a dream come true and an impassable obstacle for my own employment. If a potential employer asks me where I'll be in 5 years, I quite literally cannot give an answer. I might be in Lima. I might be Ulaanbaatar. When we found out our first post would be in India, my employer at the time didn't want to deal with the headache of the time difference and we parted ways amicably the week before the move.

For the first year of this new circumstance, I focused entirely on my writing and publishing. I haven't been idle, and achieved [some small success](/writing), but I've also learned that the publishing industry moves slowly and paying opportunities are few and far between. So I've had to accept the reality that it's unlikely I will be able to make much money from this work. Certainly not enough to save up for my son's future, or a house, or to keep the family afloat in the event of any [unforeseen setbacks](https://archive.ph/NyaJ4).

So here's where things stand: I'm still quite serious about the writing. I am proud of the two small pieces I have managed to publish and I am hopeful and confident that I will be able to publish more things in the months and years ahead. However, I have reached a point where pragmatism must supersede idealism. I need to be able to hone my writing and place pieces, but I also need to be able to earn money and tuck some away for the future.

Consequently, I have made the decision to take on freelance software work. My hope is that this will provide me with some needed flexibility around my working hours & commitments. I'm winding down an initial contract, which went well, and I'll soon be available for more. Details on my skills, preferences, and availability will be regularly updated on the new [freelance](/freelance) page of this website.

If you or your employer need something I can provide, I'm only [an email away](mailto:{{ metadata.author.email }}).
