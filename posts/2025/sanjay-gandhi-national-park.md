This week I finally took the time to go on a guided tour of the large national park that sits down on top of Mumbai. Our guide was knowledgeable and pointed out where leopards had scratched trees to mark their territory, different plant life, and several birds. I don't have too much to share aside pictures, and some brief impressions.

Impressions first. This hike was the first time in the five months that I've lived in the city that I've experienced stillness and quiet. Once you're in the heart of the park, you no longer hear the car horns. The drone of my apartment's air filters and dehumidifiers was a distant memory. It was a light hike, nothing too strenous. About halfway through we paused at an overlook and our guide told us that the park is "Mumbai's lungs." The city is so large, so populated, that if the park didn't exist as a huge CO<sub>2</sub> sink, the area would be uninhabitable.

The hike ended at the [Kanheri Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanheri_Caves), a cluster of hand-carved caves that were chiseled into the hills by Buddhist monks 2,000 years ago. When you set foot in the caves, you can't help but wonder at the changes that a place goes through as time passes. Everything in life feels so ephemeral. So fleeting, but my eyes have seen the work of hands that has passed down through the millenia.

After the hike, we grabbed a cab and sat in traffic for an hour (for a ride that's typically 20 minutes), and then shared a great lunch of South Indian curries at the Tanjore Tiffin Room in Bandra. The meal was great. They let you sample all of their curries before you order your main course.

When you move to a new city, one hard part is not knowing how to spend the perfect day when you have the time. After this week, I have a better idea of what one looks like in Mumbai.
