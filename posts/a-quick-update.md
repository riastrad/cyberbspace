**Europe » France » Burgundy**

So, a wierd thing happened about a week ago... I got off a plane, and everyone was speaking french. Luckily, I made it through customs easily and met my family without any problems. We then proceeded to get into a much smaller mini-van than I am used to and travel for almost nine hours to Palavas, a beach near Montpellier. It was very fun and I will put pictures up soon. After four days in Palavas, we travelled four hours back to Moulins, where I am now. I started school today, and it was very different from american school (mostly because it was in french...) But now it is late and I'm very tired from typing on a very different keyboard than I'm used to, so until next time, au revoir.
