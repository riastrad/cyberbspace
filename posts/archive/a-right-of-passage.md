**Europe » France » Burgundy » Baune**

Alors, pour commencer je vais parler en française, mais vous n'inquetez pas je vais écrire en anglais aussi...en fait je crois que il n'y a que de deux ou trois personnes qui peut comprendre ce que je suis en train d'écrire...bon...ça suffit je vais continuer en anglais, même si j'aime bien d'écrire en français de temps en temps...et pour ceux qu'a compris: ne dites personne que j'ai fait beaucoup des fauts.

So today, I'm writing for an incredibly important reason. Wine. Yes that's right, and not just any wine, today I visited one of the most respected one cellars in all of France. If there are any wine experts reading right now get ready for a huge name drop. Here it comes: "Bouchard Père & Fils". I know right? For those who have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about let me explain in terms that helped me understand. For starters this family of wine has been around since 1731. That's **45** years before my country officially existed!

Today I saw bottles of wine that were more than 150 years old! I didn't even think that was possible. I think it goes without saying that if your wine company has been around for more than 250 years, you're doing something right. What's even better is I'm now an advanced expert in the ways of wine tasting and and such. In fact I'm going to do something special and list all the wines that were swished around in my mouth aujourd'hui. They go something like this:

<ul>
<li class="clean"><span>Bourgogne Rouge les Coteaux des Moines 2007</span></li>
<li class="clean"><span>Monthélie 2005</span></li>
<li class="clean"><span>Beaune du Château Rouge Premier Cru 2006</span></li>
<li class="clean"><span>Volnay Caillerets Ancienne Cuvée Carnot 2004</span></li>
<li class="clean"><span>Nuits Saint-Georges Les Cailles 2004</span></li>
</ul>

And that's only the reds! I also tasted 5 other whites, as well as three additional wines with lunch. Thank you, I'm practically french now it's true. If there are some of you out there who didn't understand anything at all while reading this post, don't worry all it takes is a year or more in France to only start to understand the importance of wine in french culture. Thanks for reading, and I don't want any comments about how I've become an elitist since I've left home...
