For those of you who still receive updates from this blog and are still interested in hearing about my global travels, I have moved to Blogger! I just like the format a lot more and I think it will be much easier to deal with while abroad.

So if you'd like to hear all about my escapades in Morocco this upcoming academic year follow the link:
