**Europe » France » Auvergne » Moulins**

So today, on the eve of my one month anniversary of being in France, I've decided to do something special. Okay, it's not that special. Basically, I'm just going to share some of my newly acquired wisdom with you. All of what follows has been, of course, learned during my last 30 days in France. If you are going to be staying in a foreign country for an extended period of time in the near future I recommend you pay close attention.

<ol>
<li class="clean"><span>The majority of people outside of america believe that almost all of the United States' population is made up of overweight individuals, because of our strict McDonald's diet. (there are overweight people in every country by the way.)</span></li>

<li class="clean"><span>If your host father starts calling you "Jo Jo", stop him immediatley or you will remain "Jo Jo" for the next four months of your stay in his house.</span></li>

<li class="clean"><span>When you don't know for certain what you are eating ask either before or after eating it. NEVER DURING! Because you might find out that you currently have a mouthful of duck liver...</span></li>

<li class="clean"><span>Required spanish classes will only give you a headache and muddle your french.</span></li>
</ol>


That's all I've got at the moment. But remember I've only been hear one month, if I continue to learn four a month, that's fourty-four by the time I come home! So thanks for reading, and remember, duck liver actually isn't that bad before you know what it is.
