## So, this is where my story begins

I haven't yet left for France, and the anticipation is killing me. But like the tenacious character I am, I am some how finding it in me to soldier on. This will obviously be the first of many blogs (as long as I can remember my password), and hopefully this will make it easier for me to keep anybody and everybody informed on everything I get myself into during this upcoming year. I have everything in order, and I'll be leaving the 26th of August. My first host family seems nice judging from the few e-mails we've exchanged, and my french still remains remedial. I can't wait to see what this year has in store for me.
