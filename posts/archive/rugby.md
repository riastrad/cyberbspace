**Europe » France » Auvergne » Vichy**

So, big news...okay, not that big, but important none the less. Yesterday afternoon, I participated in my first official Rugby match, and then my second and third as well. My team travelled all the way to Vichy to participate in a four team tournament...which we took third in. Yes, we only won one of our three games...but it's not the end of the world. It was a good time, and it was even more fun singing "We are the Champions" in with a french team in our locker room after our only win. (Yes, even in France everyone knows the words to at least one Queen song.) I'm happy to say that I even scored a try! (It's like a touchdown but not.) Sorry that I don't have any pictures to post with this, but I didn't think to bring my camera...and even if I did I probably wouldn't have been able to take any pictures while I was playing...So thanks for reading, and remember, Rugby is a real man's sport!
