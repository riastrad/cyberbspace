## Backgound

I'm not extremely proactive on Twitter. I post very rarerly and when I do it's often trivial little things. But I am extremely _passive_ on Twitter. By this I mean that I'll frequently log in at different times throughout the day to scroll through the feed and see what's happening in the world. However, more and more I'm realizing that even this passive engagement is unhealthy. I find myself in a state of scrolling where I feel like a duck destined for foie gras who's being force fed a bunch of fatty junk. 

I started out the year thinking I might just trim down the list of who I'm following and set up some stricter content controls on my devices. But I've already caught myself side stepping these guard rails less than a few weeks after putting them in place. So I've decided the only real solution is purposeful privation.

Encouraged by seeing similar posts, most notably Andy Bell's [AA-inspired confessional](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/hello-i'm-andy-and-i'm-addicted-to-twitter/), I decided to finally take action and cut the supply off at the source. What follows is a brief description of how I'm doing this.

## Process

1. Use a password generator for a random 15 character string
2. Update my Twitter email and append the random thing as a `+` alias (thanks, [gmail](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-use-the-infinite-number-of-email-addresses-gmail-1609458192))
3. Drop the full email address into a message to myself for a year from today (thanks, [futureme.org](https://www.futureme.org))
4. Change my password
5. Write blog about this process
6. Post blog to Twitter so everyone knows where I went
7. Log out of Twitter on all my devices

If you see me liking, retweeting, or tweeting in the next year. You'll know I've outsmarted this little scheme and failed at this goal. Otherwise, see you all in 2021! ðŸ‘‹
