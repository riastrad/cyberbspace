As is usually the case before embarking on a journey that will span the better part of 8 months, I put off packing until the last possible second. Due in part to a nervous apprehension that takes hold of me the day before I travel, and inexplicably well developed procrastination tendencies, I have managed to be almost close to thinking I'm done packing. It is 12:30am of the day I am set to depart. Having done this before, I can safely assume that I will remember that I forgot something as I near the end of my 2 1/2 hour drive to the airport.

I snapped a quick photo during the process to help illustrate what exactly goes into it, and I mean that both literally and figuratively. My life, more or less, for the next academic year will be contained in one 50lb suitcase (see below) and two smaller carry-on bags. It's a very unusual thing to be able to fit a year of your life into a space small enough to facilitate easy transportation.

So there you have it. If all goes well, the next time I update this blog it will be from the capital city of Morocco.
