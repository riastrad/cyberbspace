## An Entirely Different Set of Questions

This was my first introduction to Borges - or as his translator affecitionally
refers to him through the footnotes "JLB" - aside from the errant short stories I
I had read here and there on the internet c.2007-11 when I had more time to read
random short fiction on the internet.

Borges is a cerebral writer of the first order. Although, someone how that classification
feels too limiting for what he's able to achieve. The prose is sparse and unladen,
though this could be as much due to the standardization that occurs in translation
as to Borges's style itself.<a class="footnote" href="#footnote-1"><sup><b>1</b></sup></a><span class="footnote-text">One of the things I've found re: reading translated texts is
that, no matter how well they're are translated, there is always a lingering doubt of whether or not the stylistic choices are the author's or the translator's. I note this without the intention to discredit the work of Andrew Huxley by any means. It's just a pernicious thought I've never been capable of shaking when reading in translation.</span>

For the most part, the stories in this collection all seemed to orbit the same core ideas of knowledge, memory, and how these to relate to and change identity. The book itself had more stories to get into so I'll just briefly note the few stores that I dog-eared<a class="footnote" href="#footnote-2"><sup><b>2</b></sup></a><span class="footnote-text">It's worth noting I almost never dog ear pages of my books. The fact that I have dog-eared pages of this collection is a sign of the impact these stories had while I read them.</span> and marked up while reading.

### The House of Asterion

A common thing, as I discovered over the course of reading these stories, when encountering Borges is finishing a story and immediately flipping back to the beginning to re-read the story. I felt this most sharply with this short story about a character trapped in a maze. I won't go into more detail. It's too great to ruin even sixty years after it's publication. I earnestly encourage you to [read it yourself](http://ddm.ace.ed.ac.uk/project-files/Asterion/story.html), if you haven't already.

### The Aleph

The titular story of this collection is one that takes seriously the possibility of knowing everything there is to know. The protagonist is shown an object that contains the entire universe within it. There are so many clever little details in how the story is set up and unfolds. The thing that led to the eventual aforementioned dog-earing of the page, however, is where Borges takes the story in the final movement of the narrative. Where you see that for Borges the premise isn't simply a gimmick to hook the reader into a compelling story. This final turn, where Borges extrapolates what would _actually_ happen if someone had suddenly seen the entirety of the Universe, hammers home the point that Borges isn't just imaginative as most writers go, he's is interested in an entirely different set of questions than almost any other author you'll read.

### In Memoriam, J.F.K.

This one is almost a free-form poem. Less than one page, and Borges manages to do this amazing. It's hard to put into words what about it spoke to me exactly without ruining some of the magic of the first read. I'll just say that this story had the best opening and closing lines of the entire book. It begins with the explosion of a muzzle and concludes with the inevitable. Absolute, dark, and beautiful.
